# S-Log
Scientific log and Scientific Blog

CSC 210 Final Group Project

An application called “S’log,” coming from Science blog and
Science log. As the name suggests, our application will serve as an archive for scientific research
as well as a hub for discussion of said research. It will allow knowledgeable users (professors,
graduate students, etc) to post summaries of scientific papers, ideally written in plain language,
for a broader (non-technical) audience. Furthermore, users can comment on posts to discuss the
research. These users could likely be undergraduates or anyone not well versed in the sciences.
The application would not only provide distilled information that they can understand, but also
give them an opportunity to engage with the work through discussion.
